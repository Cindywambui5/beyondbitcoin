                <p>I've taken quite a few other online crypto trading courses and this is by far the best one. It gets straight to the point and tells you how to make money using the trading strategies outlined. Glad I spent my money on this.</p><br>

                <p>I'm quite an experienced trader already and I thought I would take this course for the trading strategies that it advertises. I was very impressed by a particular trading indicator that the instructor recommended that I had never used before. I won't say the name of the indicator here, but it definitely made trading easier for me and better yet, it's completely free. So if anything, this course was useful in that regard.</p>

                <p>I like the trading examples that the instructor does after explaining a trading strategy. He'll place a live trade with his own money showing you how it works. I really respect that because he's putting his money where his mouth is.</p>
